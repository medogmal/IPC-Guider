      "answerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "The 7 CDC Core Elements are: (1) Leadership commitment, (2) Accountability, (3) Drug expertise, (4) Action (implementing interventions), (5) Tracking, (6) Reporting, (7) Education. Mandatory ID consultation for ALL prescriptions is not a core element, though targeted ID consultation for specific scenarios (e.g., positive blood cultures, prolonged therapy) is a common stewardship intervention.",

      "answerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "The primary goal of AMS is to optimize patient outcomes (cure infection, prevent complications) while minimizing unintended consequences including antimicrobial resistance, adverse drug events (toxicity, allergic reactions), and C. difficile infection. Cost reduction is a secondary benefit, not the primary goal.",

      "options": ["Requiring pre-authorization before prescribing restricted antibiotics", "Reviewing antibiotic prescriptions 48-72 hours after initiation and providing recommendations to prescribers", "Automatic stop orders after 7 days", "Formulary restriction"],
      "answerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Prospective audit and feedback involves reviewing antibiotic prescriptions after they have been initiated (typically 48-72 hours) and providing recommendations to prescribers (e.g., de-escalation, dose optimization, duration). Pre-authorization is a different strategy (prior authorization/restriction). Prospective audit is less disruptive to workflow and preserves prescriber autonomy while providing education.",

      "answerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "DOT measures the aggregate number of days that patients receive specific antimicrobial agents, normalized per 1,000 patient-days or days-present. It is the preferred metric for tracking antibiotic use because it accounts for combination therapy (e.g., patient on vancomycin + piperacillin-tazobactam = 2 DOT). DOT is more sensitive than DDD (Defined Daily Dose) for detecting changes in antibiotic use.",

      "options": ["Continue both antibiotics for 7-10 days", "Discontinue azithromycin and continue ceftriaxone alone (de-escalation based on negative cultures and clinical improvement)", "Switch to oral amoxicillin-clavulanate (IV-to-PO conversion)", "Add vancomycin for MRSA coverage"],
      "answerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "For CAP with negative blood cultures and clinical improvement at 48-72 hours, the best stewardship intervention is IV-to-PO conversion (switch to oral amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate). This allows earlier discharge, reduces IV line complications, and lowers costs. De-escalation (stopping azithromycin) is also appropriate if atypical coverage is no longer needed, but IV-to-PO conversion is the priority intervention for a clinically improving patient.",

      "answerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "The antibiotic timeout at 48-72 hours should assess: (1) Clinical improvement, (2) Culture results (de-escalation opportunity), (3) IV-to-PO conversion, (4) Appropriate dose/duration, (5) Need for continued therapy. Switching to more expensive broad-spectrum antibiotics without clinical indication contradicts stewardship principles. The goal is de-escalation to narrower-spectrum agents when possible.",

      "options": ["Penicillin G", "Cephalexin", "Meropenem (carbapenem)", "Azithromycin"],
      "answerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Carbapenems (meropenem, imipenem, ertapenem) are broad-spectrum antibiotics that cover Gram-positive, Gram-negative (including ESBL-producers), and anaerobic bacteria. They are commonly restricted in stewardship programs due to their association with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) and C. difficile. Penicillin G and cephalexin are narrow-spectrum; azithromycin is moderate-spectrum.",

      "options": ["3 days", "5 days", "7-10 days", "14 days"],
      "answerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "IDSA/ATS guidelines recommend 5 days of antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated CAP in patients who are clinically stable (afebrile for 48-72 hours, improving symptoms, able to take oral medications). Shorter durations (5 days vs. 7-10 days) have equivalent outcomes and reduce antibiotic exposure, resistance, and adverse events. Longer durations (14 days) are reserved for complicated cases (e.g., empyema, bacteremia).",

      "options": ["Treat with ciprofloxacin for 7 days", "Treat with nitrofurantoin for 5 days", "No antibiotic treatment (asymptomatic bacteriuria does not require treatment in most patients)", "Treat with IV ceftriaxone"],
      "answerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is the presence of bacteria in urine without symptoms. ASB does NOT require antibiotic treatment in most patients (except pregnant women and patients undergoing urologic procedures with mucosal bleeding). Treating ASB increases antibiotic resistance, adverse events, and C. difficile risk without improving outcomes. This is a key stewardship principle.",

      "answerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "An antibiogram is a periodic summary of antimicrobial susceptibility data for common pathogens isolated in a specific healthcare facility or unit. It displays the percentage of isolates susceptible to various antibiotics, helping clinicians select appropriate empiric therapy based on local resistance patterns. Antibiograms should be updated annually and stratified by unit (ICU vs. ward) when possible.",

      "answerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "With culture-confirmed Pseudomonas aeruginosa and no MRSA isolated, vancomycin should be discontinued (de-escalation). Piperacillin-tazobactam monotherapy is appropriate for susceptible Pseudomonas HAP. Continuing unnecessary vancomycin increases risk of nephrotoxicity, C. difficile, and VRE. Meropenem is unnecessarily broad. Double Pseudomonas coverage is not routinely recommended unless severe sepsis/septic shock.",

      "answerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "For cellulitis with clinical improvement and ability to tolerate oral medications, IV-to-PO conversion is appropriate. Oral cephalexin (or amoxicillin-clavulanate) provides adequate coverage for streptococci and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. IV-to-PO conversion reduces line complications, allows earlier discharge, and lowers costs without compromising outcomes. Total duration is typically 5-7 days.",

      "answerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "With negative blood cultures at 48 hours, clinical improvement, and low procalcitonin (<0.5 ng/mL), bacterial infection is unlikely. Antibiotics should be discontinued to avoid unnecessary exposure, resistance, and adverse events. Procalcitonin-guided therapy is a validated stewardship tool for reducing antibiotic duration in suspected sepsis with negative cultures. If infection is confirmed, antibiotics can be restarted.",

      "explanation": "For acute uncomplicated cystitis in non-pregnant women, first-line agents are nitrofurantoin (5 days), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (3 days if local resistance <20%), or fosfomycin (single dose). Fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin) should be reserved for complicated UTI or pyelonephritis due to resistance concerns and adverse effects (tendinopathy, C. difficile).

      "answerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "For uncomplicated MRSA bacteremia (no endocarditis, no implanted devices, cleared blood cultures within 2-4 days), the recommended duration is 14 days from the first negative blood culture.

      "answerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "For initial C. difficile infection, the recommended duration of oral vancomycin (or fidaxomicin) is 10 days, regardless of symptom resolution. Shorter durations increase recurrence risk. For severe/fulminant CDI, vancomycin 500 mg four times daily (higher dose) is recommended.

      "explanation": "M. abscessus has an inducible erm(41) gene that confers adaptive resistance to macrolides (clarithromycin, azithromycin) after 3-14 days of exposure. This is a unique resistance mechanism in M. abscessus. Treatment requires combination therapy (macrolide + amikacin + cefoxitin or imipenem) for at least 12 months. If erm(41) is induced, macrolides should be discontinued and alternative regimens (tigecycline, linezolid, clofazimine) considered. M. abscessus is one of the most difficult-to-treat mycobacteria.",

      "explanation": "For multi-drug-resistant VRE (linezolid-resistant, daptomycin-resistant), novel lipoglycopeptides (oritavancin, dalbavancin) or tedizolid (novel oxazolidinone) are options. Quinupristin-dalfopristin has activity against E. faecium but causes severe myalgias/arthralgias in 30-50% of patients, often requiring discontinuation. Oritavancin and dalbavancin have long half-lives (weekly dosing) and activity against VRE. Tigecycline is bacteriostatic and not preferred for bacteremia.
