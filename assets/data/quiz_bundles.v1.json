      "answerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "If hair removal is necessary, it should be performed using electric clippers immediately before surgery. Shaving with razors causes microscopic skin abrasions that increase SSI risk. Hair removal should only be done if it will interfere with the surgical procedure.",

      "answerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Nurse-driven catheter removal protocols with daily necessity assessments and automatic stop orders significantly reduce catheter days and CAUTI rates. Many CAUTIs occur because catheters remain in place longer than necessary. Empowering nurses to remove catheters when indications no longer exist improves outcomes.",
